I have a HUGE favor to ask. Enormous. Like ... I'm in Vegas and need a body buried cuz I got coked out and killed a hooker. 

The URL for my new YouTube Channel called RoxorSoxor is:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8UP_q-RMBd9Rl9d-LcXDg

YouTube has a rule that once you reach 100 subscribers, you can -- much like LinkedIn except they don't have any requirements -- create a custom URL. This means I could send people to "RoxorSoxor" instead of "UCe8UP_q-RMBd9Rl9d-LcXDg". 

Even if you hate the content and never watch anything, would you please subscribe so I could have a proper, professional-looking URL?

Thanks in advance. If you are ever in Vegas and need help burying a body, I will be on the first flight there. 

Please don't judge it harshly yet, I'm getting back on my feet again. Both it and me are a work in progress. Rebuilding and rebranding myself.

Thanks in advance. If you are ever in labor in a cab in a traffic jam, I will be there.
